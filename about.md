I'm a Graphic Programmer, with a Computer Engineering degree, and I've been coding since I was 15 as I wanted to enter a videogame contest at the time.
This blog is a place to dump my ideas and stuff I find while working, to remember them later and maybe help someone out in the process :D


### More Information
If you would like to know more, you can always hit me up by email at [pachesantiago@gmail.com](mailto:pachesantiago@gmail.com). I usually answer quite quickly.
